# Visitors never log in: Blacklight's own guest-user support (current_or_guest_user) owns their bookmarks, keyed by
# the session cookie (kept 30 days, config/initializers/session_store.rb). Two small differences from the gem's
# default, so that browsing does not write to the database:
#  - there is no authentication provider, so we say there is one (the guest) and that nobody is signed in;
#  - guest_user finds the visitor's row but does not create one; a new, unsaved User stands in until the first
#    record is saved (BookmarksController saves it then). Crawlers and first-time visitors leave no rows.

  # Number of saved records for the header bar, without creating a guest.
