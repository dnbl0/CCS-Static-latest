# Blacklight's search service plus two additional behaviours:
# - when a search returns nothing offers a spelling collation, run the search again with the collation
#   and mark the response so the view can explain the substitution. (From CCS-123)
#   Solr does the heavy lifting. See spellcheck.maxCollationTries in solrconfig.xml
# - when a search with filters still returns nothing, count the results without its filters (ZeroResults), so the empty
#   page can offer them. Facet counts cannot give this: they are counted inside the filtered (empty) results.
#
# Wired up as CatalogController.search_service_class, which is a class_attribute
# from Blacklight::Searchable rather than a blacklight_config property.
