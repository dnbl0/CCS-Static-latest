# blacklight-gallery's OpenSeadragon viewer (Blacklight::Gallery::OpenseadragonEmbedComponent) laid out as the CCS design's
# media viewer (Figma, "RecordTemplate"): a full-width dark band with the title, the image with round previous and next
# buttons either side and a row of 80px thumbnails, then a light toolbar with an info button and full screen (a modal of the
# record's media metadata) and full screen. The gem's component still does the viewing: its OpenSeadragon, its image
# sources, its page and full-page buttons (here Bootstrap buttons, found by the ids the gem gives them). The gem's own
# template is replaced by this component's, which sends the band to the layout (content_for :hero). No zoom (not in the
# first release): zoom buttons, mouse and keyboard navigation are off.
