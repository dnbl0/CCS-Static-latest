### Updated in this project
- Rebuilt the contact page (now `public/contact.html`; originally `Contact Us.dc.html`) using the real CONTACT_GROUPS / COLLECTION_CONTACTS data from script.js (MDHS/Vernon Collections: MHM, HFA, HBA emails; Museums & Collections: UAC, GMC external Smartsheet form)
- Added Bootstrap 5 for grid/card layout, layered with existing UoM Gen 3 tokens/typography/footer (now a local build; see BOOTSTRAP-DEPENDENCIES.md)
