# Cultural Collections Search - University of Melbourne

A static front-end prototype for searching and browsing the University of Melbourne's cultural collections (Grainger Museum, Medical History Museum, University Art Collection, Harry Brookes Allen Museum, Henry Forman Atkinson Dental Museum, and a few smaller collections).

**Design system**: UoM Gen 3 | **Bootstrap**: 5.3.3 (built locally) | **Hosting**: GitHub Pages | **Repository**: https://github.com/Enterprise-Services-Group/CCS-2026-MVP

The site is a prototype driven by an in-repo dataset (735 listed records), not a live catalogue. Accessibility work has been done and checked with axe-core scans (clean apart from the items listed under [Known issues](#known-issues--follow-ups)), but the site has **not** had a formal WCAG audit or certification.

## Recent changes

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Pages and URLs

All pages live in `public/` (the web root). They are "DC template" HTML: `{{ }}` placeholders in the markup plus a `class Component extends DCLogic` script, rendered at runtime by `public/support.js` (a generated runtime - do not edit it).

| URL | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `public/index.html` | Home (Figma design: hero search, collection cards, help and guidance, FAQ accordion) |
| `/search` | `public/search.html` | Redirect stub to `/search/search-results` (meta refresh, JS, and server redirect) |
| `/search/search-results` | `public/search/search-results.html` | Search, facets (`FACETS`), results grid/list |
| `/search/advanced-search` | `public/search/advanced-search.html` | Advanced Filters form (multi-row field search, filters, production-date range); submits to `/search/search-results` |
| `/collections` | `public/collections/index.html` | Browse all collections: the shared Browse collections cards (alphabetical), then Help and guidance |
| `/collections/<slug>` | `public/collections/<slug>/index.html` | Five landing pages: `grainger-museum`, `harry-brookes-allen-museum`, `henry-forman-atkinson-dental-museum`, `medical-history-museum`, `university-art-collection`. They share one template with per-collection data in JS dicts, so a change to the shared structure must be made in all five files |
| `/collections/record?id=<id>` | `public/collections/record.html` | Record detail and media viewer |
| `/contact` | `public/contact.html` | Contact page in the UoM contact layout: an "On this page" list beside one column (collection contacts, general enquiries, before you get in touch, help). Reuses `help-layout` and `side-nav` |
| `/about` | `public/about.html` | About Cultural Collections Search (hero, intro, key facts, feature panel, how to search, Indigenous cultural material, the shared Browse collections cards, contact links). In the header between Help and Contact; the Rails app has the same page at `/about` |
| `/help` | `public/help/index.html` | Help and guidance: one page with a section for each of FAQ, Copyright and Terms of Use, Access and Information, and Privacy (`#faq`, `#copyright`, `#access`, `#privacy`) |
| `/help/search-tips` | `public/help/search-tips.html` | Search tips, a page of its own |
| `/help/indigenous-data` | `public/help/indigenous-data.html` | Indigenous cultural data and access |

Legacy `*.dc.html` filenames (for example `Collection Search v3.dc.html`) 301-redirect to the pages above (see [Hosting](#hosting)).

Notes on directories:

- `public/blacklight-adapter.js` is loaded by `search/search-results.html` and `collections/record.html`. Its default mode is `mock` (local `collection-data.js`); `?api=live` switches to the Blacklight endpoint set in the adapter. It is covered by `tests/blacklight-adapter.test.js`.

---

## Data: how records work

`public/collection-data.js` is an IIFE that sets:

```js
window.CCS = {
  records,   // id -> display-ready record (built by build()); superseded ids are non-enumerable aliases
  items,     // normalised search items (objectType, culture, img) used by search/search-results.html
  ids,       // listed record ids
  related(id, n = 4)  // related-record cards for the record page
}
```

`ITEMS` (an array of plain objects near the top of the file) is the raw data; `build(it)` turns each item into a record. `Object.values(CCS.records)` has one entry per listed record (735 today).

### Add or edit a record

1. Add or edit an object in the `ITEMS` array. Use a unique numeric `id` that is not already in `ITEMS` or in `SUPERSEDED` (ids in use today: 1-238, 10001-10250, 20001-20250, 50001-50007, 60001-60008).
2. Use the item keys that `build()` reads, for example: `title`, `collection` (one of the constants at the top, e.g. `MHM`, `UAC`, `GMC`), `objectType`, `date`/`dateStart`/`dateEnd`, `creator`, `creatorRole`, `associatedEntity`, `place`, `description`, `series`, `material`, `dimensions`, `inscription`, `language`, `culturalAffiliation`, `accession`, `named`, `access`, `classification`, `subject`/`subjects`, `relatedParent`/`relatedChild`/`relatedRecord`, `copyright`, `creditLine`, `licence`, `advisories`, `img` or `images`.
3. Leave a field out and it is not shown; no placeholder is rendered.
4. Run `npm test`. `collection-data.test.js` checks unique ids, non-empty titles, that every field label is one of the specification labels, and that referenced `/assets` files exist.

### Superseded records (`SUPERSEDED`)

Some early prototype stubs duplicate a fuller record. `SUPERSEDED = { oldId: canonicalId, ... }` folds them: `records[oldId]` still resolves (old links keep working) to the canonical record, but the old id is not enumerable, so it is not listed or counted twice. To retire a duplicate, add `oldId: canonicalId` to the map; the old item is dropped from `ACTIVE`.

### Digital assets (`ASSET_IMAGES`, `ASSET_AV`)

- `ASSET_IMAGES` maps a record id to a list of file names in `public/assets/images/collections/` (the filename stem is the accession number with `.` replaced by `_`; numbered suffixes are extra views). Files are URL-encoded and served from `/assets/images/collections/`.
- `ASSET_AV` maps a record id to audio/video objects `{ kind: 'audio'|'video', src, type, label }` with files in `public/assets/data/`. They play in the media viewer after any images.
- Records without an `ASSET_IMAGES` entry fall back to the web image named by `img` (or `images`) in `public/images/`.
- Add the file under `public/assets/...` first (not the top-level `assets/`, which is not deployed), then add the mapping.

---

## Field labels and the spreadsheet

Field labels, sequence numbers, filters and mandatory/optional rules follow the two workbooks in `assets/` (CCS Field labels and filters - Final - PRG - 1 OCT 2026.xlsx and CCS Data inventory - final.xlsx), extracted to `data-model/` and enforced by `tests/data-model.test.js`; see `docs/data-model.md`.

- Record page fields: the `f` array in `build()` in `public/collection-data.js` (`[seq, label, lines]`). Rights fields (16, 17, 29) come from the `rights` array; media metadata (Title, Format, Licence type, Terms of use, Advisory ...) from `media`.
- Filters: the `FACETS` array in `public/search/search-results.html` (group, key, title, kind).

### Field mapping (spreadsheet "#" and Display Field to site label)

| # | Spreadsheet field | Site label / location |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title | Page heading (`title`) |
| 2 | Object Type | Object type |
| 3 | Date | Date |
| 4 | Creator | Creator |
| 5 | Associated Entity | Associated entity |
| 6 | Place | Place |

| 28 | Advisory | Advisory (media metadata) |
| 29 | Terms of Use | Terms of use (rights block and media metadata, records with digital assets) |
| 30 | Producer | Producer (no record populates it yet) |

Filter groups in the spreadsheet map to `FACETS` groups in `search/search-results.html`: Collection details, Creator, Object, Subject / topic, Copyright & advisory, Access, Media type.

## Advanced Search

`public/search/advanced-search.html` is a stand-alone form built from the Figma Advanced Filters frames. Markup uses the reusable classes in `public/styles/advanced-filters.css` (`.ccs-banner`, `.ccs-page`, `.ccs-combo`, `.ccs-input`, `.ccs-date` / `.ccs-cal`, `.ccs-btn`, `.ccs-delete`, `.ccs-instructions`, `.ccs-errors`). Its logic lives in `public/search/advanced-search-form.js` (plain JS, no framework; option lists and counts are built from `window.CCS.items`) and is made of three small components: `Select` (single-select combobox/listbox), `Multi` (checkbox menu, used by filter values and "Add filter") and `DateField` (typed date + calendar popover). Keyboard: Arrow keys, Home, End, Enter, Space, Esc and Tab; menus close on selection (single), Esc, outside click or re-activating the field, and multi-select menus stay open while ticking. Search rows range from 1 to 8 (the last row cannot be deleted). Dates accept digits and `/` only (`dd/mm/yyyy` or a year; a leading minus means BCE), must lie between the earliest and latest dates in `window.CCS.items`, and an end date cannot precede the start date; invalid input shows an error beside the field and in a summary at the top of the form. It is a plain GET form that opens the results page, `search/search-results.html`, with these URL parameters (the results page parses them in `parseAdvancedParams`):

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `clause[i][field]` | `all_fields`, `title`, `creator`, `subject` or `description` |
| `clause[i][op]` | `must` (contains all), `should` (contains any) or `must_not` (does not contain) |
| `clause[i][query]` | search text; `"quotes"` make an exact phrase |
| `f_inclusive[key][]` | filter values where ANY may match; `key` is `collection`, `type`, `creator`, `licence` or `access` |
| `f[key][]` | filter values where ALL must match |
| `range[year][begin]`, `range[year][end]` | production year range (the form sends the year of the chosen date) |
| `sort` | `relevance`, `year-desc`, `year-asc` or `az` |

Rows combine as: every `must` row matches, at least one `should` row matches (if any exist), and no `must_not` row matches. The results page shows each row and filter as a removable chip, and its "Advanced Search" button re-opens the form pre-filled with the current search (`advancedFormHref`). Empty rows are not sent, so URLs stay short.

## Record page behaviour

`public/collections/record.html?id=<id>`:

- Reads `window.CCS.records[id]`. An unknown or missing id shows "Record not found" and sets that as the document title. A found record sets the title to `<record title> - Cultural Collections Search - University of Melbourne`.
- Only the **Contact us** button opens the request dialog. Tabs: General enquiry, Request to use, Request to view. The dialog traps focus, closes on Esc, and returns focus to the opener. Submitting only shows a confirmation; nothing is sent anywhere.
- Media viewer shows images, audio and video from `slides`, with thumbnails and a metadata sidebar. The viewer handles keyboard shortcuts only while it has focus or is full screen (see the script in `record.html` for the exact keys).
- "Copy persistent link" and citation formats are generated from the record.

---

## Styling

- **Bootstrap 5.3.3** is compiled locally from `src/scss/custom-bootstrap.scss` (sharp corners, no shadows, UoM colours) into `public/styles/vendor/bootstrap-uom.min.css`. This file is committed because the deploy runs no Sass build. Rebuild with `npm run build:css` (`build:css:dev` and `watch:css` write an unminified `bootstrap-uom.css`). After Sass compiles, `scripts/purge-css.js` removes every rule whose classes appear nowhere in the pages or scripts (the committed file is about 26 KB instead of 227 KB); **after adding a Bootstrap class to a page, run `npm run build:css` and commit the result**, otherwise the class has no CSS. Every page links the compiled file; only `index.html` also loads the Bootstrap JS bundle from jsDelivr (version-pinned with an SRI hash).
- **Live CSS**: everything under `public/styles/`: `tokens/tokens.css` (primitive, semantic and component tokens; see docs/design-tokens/README.md, including the Figma export), `base.css`, `components/` (shared pieces such as `ccs.css`, `header.css`, `collection.css`) and `pages/<page>.css`. Layout rules are in design.md and enforced by `tests/stylesheet-structure.test.js`.
- **Page styles (no inline styles)**: each page links its own `public/styles/pages/<page>.css` (class rules, scoped by the `page-<page>` class on `<body>` so they win over shared component CSS the way the old inline styles did) (shared pieces live in `public/styles/components/`, element defaults in `base.css`, colours in `tokens/`). Do not add `style=""` attributes or `<style>` blocks; add a class and a rule instead. For a value that only the page logic knows, set a custom property inline (`style="--dyn-height:{{ b.h }}"`) and use `var(--dyn-height)` in the stylesheet. The five collection landing pages share `collection-landing*.css`.
- **Content templates (Matrix patterns)**: `public/styles/components/content-templates.css` holds the components modelled on the University's Matrix CMS content templates (unimelb.edu.au/web/matrix-cms/content-templates and /styling-content): `ct-listing` (Page Listing: image or text lists, `--alt` grey band), `pathfinder` (the Design System Pathfinder: `grid grid--cols-3|4 grid--collapsed` of `pathfinder` tiles with `--alt` and `--inverse` modifiers, the footer arrow as the title icon), `contact-box`, `notice` (`--warning`, `--success`), `side-nav`, `def-table`, `contact-cards`, `steps-list`, and the help/collection layouts (`help-layout`, `collection-layout`). Used by Browse collections, the five collection pages, Help and Indigenous data. Reuse these before writing new page CSS; values (type sizes, colours) were measured from the Matrix pages.
- **Record media access rules**: `webAccess`, `accessMessage`, `viewRestricted`, `usageNotice` and `caption` are computed in `public/collection-data.js` (see `jira-mvp-mapping.md`, CCS-27/45/50/68/69). Licence types live in the `LIC` table there; `Not licensed` hides the media and offers a request to view.
- **Tests**: `npm test` also runs `tests/image-aspect.test.js` (needs playwright-core and Chromium; skipped otherwise). Request types, the PDF viewer, the Theme filter and recent searches are described in `jira-mvp-mapping.md`.
- **Accessibility**: `tests/accessibility.test.js` runs axe-core (WCAG 2.1 A/AA) plus 320px reflow and title checks; keep it passing. The manual checklist is in `jira-mvp-mapping.md` (WCAG 2.1 AA pass). Do not claim conformance without a formal audit.
- **Fuzzy and semantic search**: `public/search/smart-search.js` (loaded by the search page) provides fuzzy, prefix and thesaurus-based matching with no backend; edit the `SYNONYMS` and `BROADER` tables there to teach it new vocabulary. `tests/smart-search.test.js` checks it against the catalogue. See `jira-mvp-mapping.md`.

- **Filters modal**: the search page's Filters panel follows the Gen 3 Modal component (white panel, navy 80% blanket, Fraunces heading, top-right Close with a visible label). It adds a "Find a filter" box, a removable "Selected" chip list and a live "Show N records" button, with the header and footer fixed while the filters scroll. Its styles are the `search-results-filters-title__*` and `filters-*` rules in `public/styles/pages/search-results/ (split by component: layout, results, toolbar, banner, flyout, filters, facet-rail, pagination, pills)`.
- **Mobile header and menu** (1023px and below): one 96px row (logo block with a 1px divider, site name, Menu button with a 32px icon over a 14px label), measured from the UniMelb mobile header (study.unimelb.edu.au). Menu opens a right-hand drawer (390px at most, page dimmed behind) with search, 63px rows (18px/600, light-blue right chevron for sub-menus) and the UniMelb audience links (14px sage uppercase). A row with a sub-menu drills in: a Back row, the section link, then its links indented 32px. The Back row is added by `public/nav.js`; styles are in `public/styles/home.css`.
- **Search bar collection menu**: the "All collections" menu sits left of the search button on the homepage (`public/search-bar.js`) and the results page; choosing a collection searches only that collection (`?collection=` in the URL). The older `scope` URL parameter (title, creator, subject) still works for advanced search links but has no menu. `/help` is one page of sections (`help-section`: a heading, a description and a list of sub headings with descriptions); Search tips and Indigenous data have pages of their own.
- **Class naming**: `block__element` (BEM style), where the block is the nearest section, form or id and the element describes the thing (`__heading`, `__item-link`, `__button-clear-all`); repeated look-alikes with different styling get `--v1`, `--v2`. Names are labels for humans; do not rely on them from scripts.
- **Components** (plain CSS classes + static markup, no build step): `home.css` defines **Navigation** (`.ccs-nav--header`, `.ccs-nav--footer`) and **Section** (`.ccs-section--hero | intro | cards | help | faq`, plus the shared `.ccs-link` and `.ccs-acc` accordion). The header/footer markup is repeated in every page (there is no include mechanism), so a change must be made in all of them; `nav.js` provides the dropdown and drawer behaviour. `advanced-filters.css` defines the form components listed under Advanced Search. Hidden/shown state of menus is driven by `aria-expanded` and CSS rather than the `hidden` attribute where the DC template layer could re-render the markup.
- **Fonts**: Fraunces (headings), Source Sans 3 (body) and Source Code Pro (code) from Google Fonts. The homepage and Advanced Filters pages request Fraunces with its SOFT/WONK axes (the Figma heading settings); the homepage matches the families and weights loaded by unimelb.edu.au.
- Bootstrap's `!important` utilities can override same-named custom classes; check for collisions when naming new classes.

Design tokens and rationale: see `design.md`. Bootstrap details: `BOOTSTRAP-DEPENDENCIES.md`.

## Develop, test and deploy

```bash
npm ci            # installs bootstrap, sass and playwright-core (dev dependencies only)
npm run build:css # rebuild public/styles/vendor/bootstrap-uom.min.css
npm test          # full check, see below
python3 -m http.server 8933 --directory public   # local server (as in .claude/launch.json)
```

Clean URLs (`/search/search-results`, `/collections/record`) only resolve on a host that applies `vercel.json` or `.htaccess`; with a plain static server use the `.html` paths.

### What `npm test` runs

1. `build:css` - compiles Bootstrap (fails on Sass errors).
2. `verify-bootstrap.sh` - for each page referencing Bootstrap, checks that the compiled `bootstrap-uom.min.css` exists (or that any CDN reference is version 5.3.3 with SRI).
3. `tests/blacklight-adapter.test.js` - default mode is `mock`, request-parameter building and document transformation.
4. `tests/page-integrity.test.js` - every `public/**/*.html` has a `<title>` and `lang`, no merge-conflict markers, and every local `href`/`src` resolves (clean-URL forms like `/search/search-results` resolve to `.html`/`index.html`). Broken css/js/page links fail; broken image links only warn.
5. `tests/collection-data.test.js` - loads `collection-data.js` in a bare sandbox; checks unique ids, titles, that field labels come from the specification list, and that `/assets` media files exist.
6. `tests/no-inline-styles.test.js` - fails if a page contains a `<style>` block, a `style-hover` attribute or a `style` attribute that is not a pure CSS-custom-property pass-through.
7. `tests/advanced-filters.test.js` - browser test (playwright-core with a Chromium build) of the Advanced Filters page: responsive layout at 1440 and 390px, dropdown keyboard behaviour and ARIA roles, multi-select and Add filter, row management limits, submission URL, pre-fill and Reset, and date-range validation. It starts its own static server. If no Chromium is found it prints `SKIP` and passes; set `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH` or run `npx playwright-core install chromium` to enable it locally.

**Warnings policy**: failures exit non-zero and fail CI. Warnings (printed as `WARNING:`) are informational and never fail the build; they track open data/content gaps (see Known issues). Current output: 0 failures, 5 warnings (no `<h1>` in `search.html`; the four unpopulated spec fields).

### CI and merge workflow

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Node 20, `npm ci` (or `npm install` without a lockfile), installs Chromium for the browser test, then `npm test`, on every pull request and push to `main`.
- `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`: pushes to `feature/**`, `bugfix/**` or `enhance/**` that change html/css/js/md files and have 3+ commits or 2+ changed files open (or reuse) a PR against `main`, run basic documentation/structure checks, approve it, and squash-merge it. It does not run `npm test` itself. Auto-approval only works if the repository setting **Settings > Actions > General > "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** is enabled; otherwise the approve step logs a warning and the job continues to the merge step. See `github.md` and `.agents/rules/pr-workflow.md`.
- `.github/workflows/rails-ci.yml`: Rails tests, system tests, rubocop and `npm run parity` (static pages against their Rails twins). All four checks (`test`, `rails`, `system`, `parity`) must pass before a pull request is merged.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml`: on push to `main` of the organisation repo, builds `public/` into `dist/` (`scripts/build-pages.js`) and publishes it with GitHub Pages. It does nothing on forks or personal copies.

### Hosting

Published with GitHub Pages from the organisation repository (`Enterprise-Services-Group/CCS-2026-MVP`) by `pages.yml`; the site is public at https://enterprise-services-group.github.io/CCS-2026-MVP/. Vercel is no longer used. Changes reach it in two steps: a pull request into `main` of the personal repository (`dnbl0/CCS-Static-latest`), then a sync pull request into the organisation repository, which deploys when merged.

- `scripts/build-pages.js` prefixes links with the Pages base path, serves `/item/:code` through `404.html` and writes redirect pages for the legacy URLs.
- `vercel.json`: `cleanUrls: true`, `trailingSlash: false`, and 301 redirects from the legacy `*.dc.html` names and from `/search` and `/search.html` to `/search/search-results`. It is no longer deployed, but `scripts/dev-server.js` and `scripts/build-pages.js` read it.
- `public/.htaccess`: the Apache equivalent (redirects plus clean-URL rewrites) for hosting on Apache.
- Local preview: `PORT=3000 node scripts/dev-server.js`, then open `http://localhost:3000/about.html` (any page).

### Generated files and the Rails app

Some files are written by scripts; edit their source, then run the script (`npm test` fails if a copy is stale):

| Edit | Run | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/partials/*.html` (header, search overlay, footer, browse-collections) | `npm run sync:partials` | the header, overlay and footer of every page in `public/`, and the Browse collections cards on the home, About and Collections pages |
| `src/collection-landing.template.html` | `npm run build:collections` | `public/collections/<slug>/index.html` |
| `public/styles/tokens`, `components`, `pages` and `public/images` | `npm run sync:rails` | the Rails copies in `ead-ccs-test/app/assets` |

`npm run lint` runs ESLint and Stylelint. `npm run parity` (with this site on :3100 and the Rails app on :3200) compares the
static pages with their Rails twins (content pages, header navigation and the search results page: card, toolbar, chips, filter rail, pagination, back-to-top and empty state, with the intentional differences listed in `scripts/parity.js`); it runs in `.github/workflows/rails-ci.yml`. The Rails app and the plan to keep both
codebases clean are described in `ead-ccs-test/README.md` and `docs/code-quality-plan.md`.

- **Accession numbers**: 15 of 735 records have no accession number (the data owner needs to supply them). `npm test` reports `accession number present on 720/735 records`.
- **Unpopulated spec fields**: Editions, Source URL, Related child record and Producer are supported by `build()` but no record sets them (reported as test warnings).
- **`search.html`** redirect stub has no `<h1>` (test warning).
- **Hosting behaviour unverified**: the redirects in `vercel.json` are applied by `scripts/build-pages.js` for GitHub Pages; check them on the live site after changing them.
- **Thin audio/video data**: only two audio/video items exist, so the sound-recording and film browse tiles map to small keyword searches.
- **Object type facet is long**: object types are free text (about 370 distinct values), so the Object type facet is long and uneven.
- **Accessibility**: axe-core scans of the pages were clean except for the items above; there has been no formal WCAG audit, manual screen-reader pass or certification.
- **Data is a prototype snapshot**: records are hand-maintained in `collection-data.js`; the Blacklight adapter's live mode is not part of the tested flow.
- **Jira mapping**: several requirement rows in `jira-mvp-mapping.md` are marked as not re-verified.

### Free catalog API (2026-10-04)
- `api/catalog.js` is a serverless function that serves `/catalog.json` and `/catalog/:id.json` in the Blacklight JSON shape (see `jira-mvp-mapping.md`). It is not deployed: GitHub Pages hosts static files only, so the results page defaults to the local catalogue and `npm run dev` serves the function for local use.

### Search acceptance criteria (2026-10-04)
- CCS-158: a "Did you mean" notice appears above results for misspelt or partial words and runs the corrected search.
- CCS-27: the record page Copyright box lists accession number, caption (digital assets only), credit line and copyright.
- CCS-116: whole-phrase meanings in `smart-search.js` (`PHRASES`).

### Search results banner and sticky tools bar (2026-10-04)
- Fix: the search form now lives permanently in the banner. The sticky bar holds only the tools plus a compact search box that appears when stuck, so its height no longer flips between a tall and a short layout while scrolling. The smart-search notices sit in their own full-width row (`.search-results-notices`) above the results grid.
- The `.ccs-hero__search` layout (form with a link stacked under it) lives in `public/styles/components/hero-search.css`, loaded by the homepage and the search results page.
- The results page banner is now compact (title plus a "N results for “query”" line). The search form sits inside the banner on the navy strip.
- Below it, one sticky `.search-results-bar` holds Sort, Filters, the Digital asset switch, the view toggle and Save this search. An IntersectionObserver sentinel adds `is-stuck` once the banner scrolls away. When stuck, the search box stays visible next to the tools on desktop and tablet.
- On phones the bar stacks: search, then Sort | Filters, then Digital asset | view | Save (icon only). When stuck it shrinks to the search row plus Sort | Filters | Digital.
- The per-page selector moved to sit above the pagination. CSS lives in `public/styles/pages/search-results/ (split by component: layout, results, toolbar, banner, flyout, filters, facet-rail, pagination, pills)`.
- Follow-up: banner and search strip padding increased; the search form reuses the homepage `ccs-hero__search` wrapper (full width, Advanced Search underneath). When stuck, Advanced Search is hidden, the bar is one row from 1280px and two rows below, and all controls are 48px tall.
- Scope menu and suggestions now open over the sticky bar (banner z-index above it).
- The banner's Advanced Search link is now a toggle ("Advanced Search" / "Hide advanced search") that opens the advanced form inline: an iframe of `/search/advanced-search?embed=1` pre-filled with the current search, auto-sized through a `postMessage` of its height. In `?embed=1` mode the page hides the header, breadcrumbs, banner, help and footer and uses compact spacing (`html.is-embed` rules in `styles/advanced-filters.css`); submitting targets the top window.
- Advanced Search page: heading renamed "Advanced Search" (banner, breadcrumb, test), "Add filter" label is light on the dark desktop field (dark on the sage phone field), and Reset / Search sit at the right.
