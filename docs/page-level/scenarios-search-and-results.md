# Scenario catalogue: search, results, filters, advanced search, search history

Source: research agent, 2026-10-12 (code read only; nothing run). Rails paths under `ead-ccs-test/`, static under `public/`.

Key numbers
- Per page: 12, 24, 40 or 96; default 40 (`catalog_controller.rb:21-22`).
- Sort: relevance, date (newest), date (oldest), title (A-Z), title (Z-A). Static has no Z-A.
- Search text: 255 characters max.
- Pagination: current page +/-2, plus first and last, with ellipsis (`1 ... 4 5 6 7 8 ... 74`). Rails `_results_pagination.html.erb:1-5`; Static `search-results.html:1346-1354`.
- Numbers: thousands separators ("1,234 results"), singular "1 result".
- Facet values before "Show all N": 12 for short-value filters, 6 for the rest. Facet search box everywhere except theme, licence, access, film, format.
- Max page: no cap configured.

## Components (code names)
Rails: `SearchBannerComponent`, `HeroSearchComponent`, `SearchOverlayComponent`, `HeaderComponent`, `SavedBarComponent`,
`BreadcrumbComponent`, `ConstraintsComponent`, `ResultCardComponent` (`result-card--media` / `--no-media`), `SaveControlComponent`,
`FilterToggleComponent`, `FilterSidebarComponent`, `FacetFieldComponent`, `FacetItemComponent`, `AdvancedSearchFormComponent`,
`SpellingCorrectionComponent`, partials `_zero_results`, `unavailable`. Stimulus: search-overlay, advanced-flyout,
advanced-search, select-dropdown, filter-drawer, filter-toggle, facet-dropdowns, facet-panel, range-slider, tooltip, saved-bar,
back-to-top. Static: `search-results-*`, `facet-rail__*`, `search-results-pill`.

## Rails vs Static
Sort (Static no Z-A); zero-results title; spelling (Rails auto-retry alert vs Static "Did you mean" plus smart notices); filters
(Rails ~12 facets vs Static ~27 with modal); pagination range text (Static only); errors (Rails 503 + flash vs Static year
errors and API pill); loading (Rails loader + skeleton vs Static 420ms cards); Static-only "Save this search".
Open questions: Rails deep `page=` value; on-screen state when histogram fetch fails.
