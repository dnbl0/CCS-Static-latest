# Scenario catalogue: home, browse, collection landing, about, contact, help, search tips, Indigenous data

Source: research agent, 2026-10-12 (code read only, app not run). Rails text lives in `ead-ccs-test/config/pages.yml`
(`app/models/site_pages.rb`). Static collection data is the `COPY`/`VISITS`/`BANNERS` dicts in
`src/collection-landing.template.html` (~lines 360-770), baked into 5 pages under `public/collections/<slug>/`.

## Cross-cutting facts
- No page shows a record count. Rails fetches `@counts`/`@named_counts` from Solr (`pages_controller.rb:12-15`) but no view uses them. Static filters "Total items" and "Date range" out of the details.
- All 5 collections have a banner image. There is no "no banner" variant. All 5 have `visit_url` and `website.url`.
- Landing layout is identical for all 5. Only the text varies.

## Components to check (code names)
Layout and chrome: `Header` / `ccs-nav--header`, `SiteFooter`, `PageBreadcrumbsComponent`, `SavedBarComponent`. Banners:
`PageBannerComponent`, `campaign-banner-split` (with `.button`), `ccs-hero`, `about-hero`. Home and listing: `ccs-section`,
`ccs-card(s)`, `ccs-help` card, `ccs-faq` + `ccs-acc` (details/summary accordion), `ccs-link`, `ct-link`, `ct-button`,
`ct-listing`, `PathfinderItemComponent` (`alt`, `external`), `grid--cols-3/4`. Content blocks: `link-strip`, `about-journey`,
`about-split`, `about-support`, `about-data`, `about-help`. Help and contact: `side-nav` (current), `help-layout`, `help-section`,
`cta-band`, `contact-box`, `def-table`, `notice notice--warning`, `help-search-tips`. Other: country acknowledgement
`dialog.modal`, `skip-link`.

## Rails vs Static differences
Daily Acknowledgement modal (Rails only); saved bar in breadcrumb strip (Rails only); Rails renders landing from YAML and 404s
unknown slugs, Static serves 5 baked pages with `?collection=KEY` fallback; banner markup differs (`section[aria-labelledby]` vs
`header[role=presentation]`); link conversion differs (sanitize vs JS markdown); card image paths differ; Static contact rows from
JS; Rails 301s `?topic=`; both have the dead `#` form link; Rails home card names do not match their link targets.
